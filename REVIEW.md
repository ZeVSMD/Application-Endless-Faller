# Project Review

The project took me overall about 10 hours to complete and playtest it thoroughly. I planned how I would implement it beforehand and I like the result.

Most of the assets and solutions were already existing in my previous projects, so it was just a matter of reassembling/rewriting everything so that it works and plays good in the task at hand.

I also completed most of the bonus points, except for auto-testing and not using PlayerPrefs, as I always used third party solutions for saving, and it is not allowed. So here it's PlayerPrefs.

The hardest part was the proper platforms generation: the first solution was not good, so I used a different approach with separate prefabs. I left the WIP code disabled.

Thank you for giving me a chance to participate in this challenge.
